Prezi Access
============

A simple developer app that enables to connect to a prezi.com account and check your prezis, including the content.xmls.

It was created by reverse engineering the official iOS Prezi app. Any change could happen to these APIs by Prezi so it could break any time.

Lists prezis. Checks license infos.

Download PEZ files, extracts and shows content.xml from them.

This was a research project therefore it needs a major refactor.
